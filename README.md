# QamblingChain Core integration

QamblingChain (QCN) is a masternode based crypto currency for the gambling industry and the problem that we wish to solve is the fast transaction requirements that these types of websites have and also the anonymous needs of the users and to achieve high speed transactions on the gambling websites. Our Blockchain will be anonymous and highly secure in order to insure all transactions will stay on the same QCN Network and the network will be anonymous and responsive between users. Each user will have an ID Number and users will not need to login with e-mail, or phone number, or their name! Login and authentication will be with ID and password and QCN accounts will be safe and anonymous for all users. Users that purchase QCN masternodes will need to fill out a form, when we finish the development of iOS and Android apps, user will login with their ID and password and they will see the coins that they purchased in the secure anonymous wallet.
